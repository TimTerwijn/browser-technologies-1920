# 3 important things
## What makes me proud
The server works and the App is almost functional except add image and go to previous image on a Apple device.

## Where am I stuck
I don't get Heroku to work because the server folder is not my real root folder.

## How did I solve a problem
I thought why don't I make the image onclick go to the next image and use the back button to se the previous image, but then I was told that Apple devices don't have a back button.
